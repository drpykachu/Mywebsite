                I am a chemical engineer that is passionate to sovling the world's energy crisis through renewable
                energy means. During my academic career I have researched and developed thermo-chemical energy storage,
                biooil and biofuel synthesis, and organic molecule electrooxidation methods to help provide alternate
                technologies for a green economy.

                <br>
                During my research roles, I have designed, built, and further developed several apparatusses to
                characterize catalysts for the production of clean energy. High vacuum technology is an integral
                component in
                several of my devices, as it is necessary for several development and characterization methods, such as
                nickel single-crystal manufacturing and differential electrochemical mass spectrometry measurements,
                respectively.

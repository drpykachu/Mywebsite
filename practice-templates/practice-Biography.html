                    I am a chemical engineer that is passionate to sovling the world's energy crisis through renewable
                    energy means. During my academic career I have researched and developed thermo-chemical energy
                    storage,
                    biooil and biofuel synthesis, and organic molecule electrooxidation methods to help provide
                    alternate
                    technologies for a green economy.

                    During my research roles, I have designed, built, and further developed several apparatusses to
                    characterize catalysts for the production of clean energy. High vacuum technology is an integral
                    component in
                    several of my devices, as it is necessary for several development and characterization methods, such
                    as
                    nickel single-crystal manufacturing and differential electrochemical mass spectrometry measurements,
                    respectively.

                                Born and raised in San Diego, I was always outside trying to absorb as much of the world
                                (and
                                the sun) as much as I could. I was a part of the Boy Scouts Of America during my youth,
                                which
                                allowed me to see more of the world than my backyard. I went many excursions during my
                                time in
                                scouts, with the honorable
                                mentions of: backpacking over 100 miles in New Mexico,
                                eating fresh lobster while sailing in the Florida Keys, and viewing the starscape while
                                trying to sleep in a cave in the Mojave Desert.

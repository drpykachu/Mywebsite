# Person Website Guide

This is a guide showing the steps I took to make my personal website. I started the process of making a website several months ago, but I had problems following outdated and confusing guides. I trudged my way through several different guides and once I was done, I decided to make my own guide for those who end up in the same situation. 

## Part 1: Hardware

I chose to host my website on a raspberry pi 3. You can get them for relatively cheap price, and can always update later if you need more processing power for your server.

List of items I used:

[Power Supply](https://www.adafruit.com/product/1995)

[Micro SD Card](https://www.amazon.com/Lexar-Micro-microSDXC-Memory-Adapter/dp/B09JNKHJ2Q/ref=sr_1_1_sspa?crid=1U2FUKCPAEENW&dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.OpZe35jasjrIiod5BQLRghJ1B-vezANiAB-x9_gaWQ2QWcVSBmSjNuuIzSw5BfYBgDTBwveI-hnxVi5gjLfwJhRR1CjwuJ41onba1UEikHfOZ_IEfc8y7YjiE37JJC9B_QTsF8EalXyPH_bN1hl2C6GaBnzAYjblMcuFFf7HNoMKf6PuoiwtWpi6Vnr1l8uM7ydM2WhxuC-oVcxBquROatTQc6v9zuUzeUV-fR1DULizUU_QEtVbQM_EFS29wt_nDSRVDTvkOablYgLKwiUhPQRXCe6y6BAZgEmGpntNrQ4.nCtwTVkNOG6pwe3cXq83kch8LXcfHLBbQWK-tE81Je0&dib_tag=se&keywords=micro+sd+memory+card+and+adapter&qid=1710813911&s=pc&sprefix=micro+sd+memory+card+and+adabpte%2Ccomputers%2C165&sr=1-1-spons&sp_csd=d2lkZ2V0TmFtZT1zcF9hdGY&psc=1&smid=A23RK926ENO7O6)

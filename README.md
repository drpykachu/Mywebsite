# Person Website Guide

This is a guide showing the steps I took to make my personal website. I started the process of making a website several months ago, but I had problems following outdated and confusing guides. I trudged my way through several different guides and once I was done, I decided to make my own guide for those who end up in the same situation. 

## Part 1: Hardware

I chose to host my website on a raspberry pi 3. You can get them for relatively cheap price, and can always update later if you need more processing power for your server.

List of items I used:

1.) [Raspberry Pi 3 Model B](https://www.adafruit.com/product/3775?src=raspberrypi) \
2.) [Power Supply](https://www.adafruit.com/product/1995)\
3.) [Micro SD Card](https://www.amazon.com/Lexar-Micro-microSDXC-Memory-Adapter/dp/B09JNKHJ2Q/ref=sr_1_1_sspa?crid=1U2FUKCPAEENW&dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.OpZe35jasjrIiod5BQLRghJ1B-vezANiAB-x9_gaWQ2QWcVSBmSjNuuIzSw5BfYBgDTBwveI-hnxVi5gjLfwJhRR1CjwuJ41onba1UEikHfOZ_IEfc8y7YjiE37JJC9B_QTsF8EalXyPH_bN1hl2C6GaBnzAYjblMcuFFf7HNoMKf6PuoiwtWpi6Vnr1l8uM7ydM2WhxuC-oVcxBquROatTQc6v9zuUzeUV-fR1DULizUU_QEtVbQM_EFS29wt_nDSRVDTvkOablYgLKwiUhPQRXCe6y6BAZgEmGpntNrQ4.nCtwTVkNOG6pwe3cXq83kch8LXcfHLBbQWK-tE81Je0&dib_tag=se&keywords=micro+sd+memory+card+and+adapter&qid=1710813911&s=pc&sprefix=micro+sd+memory+card+and+adabpte%2Ccomputers%2C165&sr=1-1-spons&sp_csd=d2lkZ2V0TmFtZT1zcF9hdGY&psc=1&smid=A23RK926ENO7O6) \
4.) Raspberry Pi 3 Model B case (I 3D-printed mine with this [model](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:3719217)) \
5.) Computer equipment (monitor, mouse, keyboard)

## Part 2: Installing Operating System

The brains of the Raspberry Pi are located in the Micro SD Card. The SD card comes blank, so it needs to be installed with the correct operating system in order to interact with the microchips on the pi. Head over to [Raspberrypi.com](https://www.raspberrypi.com/products/raspberry-pi-3-model-b/) to install the correct operating system for your pi. You will need to download the [Raspberry Pi Imager](https://www.raspberrypi.com/software/) to flash the operating system.

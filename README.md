# Person Website Guide

This is a guide showing the steps I took to make my personal website. I started the process of making a website several months ago, but I had problems following outdated and confusing guides. I trudged my way through several different guides and once I was done, I decided to make my own guide for those who end up in the same situation. 

## Part 1: Hardware

I chose to host my website on a raspberry pi 3. You can get them for relatively cheap price, and can always update later if you need more processing power for your server.
